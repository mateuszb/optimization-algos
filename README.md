# What is this repository?

This repository demonstrates a few optimization algorithms that I use for various optimization tasks in my
programming projects.

## Motivation

The reason for opening it up is to show how some of the methods are implemented in practice.
There's often a shortage of implementations of some of the algorithms making people rely on inefficient
or broken implementations.

Hopefully this will help illustrate some of the methods.


## Limitations
This code is extracted from my private repository that has a larger collection of methods and as such 
does not come with makefiles or any build system. The headers are largely meant to be included to take full
advantage of templating in C++ and optimization passes this affords.
